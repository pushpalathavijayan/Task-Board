TaskBoard is a full-stack web application built using React on the frontend and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the backend. The project implements user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), allowing users to register, log in, and access protected features. After logging in, users can manage their personal tasks by creating new tasks, viewing existing ones, marking tasks as completed, and deleting them. All task data is stored in MongoDB, and each user only sees their own tasks.

In addition to the task system, the application includes a simple global chat feature. All authenticated users can send and view messages, which are stored in a separate MongoDB collection. The frontend is built using Vite for fast development, TailwindCSS for styling, Axios for API communication, and React Context for global state management. The backend exposes REST APIs for authentication, task management, and chat messages, and applies middleware to verify JWT tokens before granting access to protected routes.

To run the backend, install dependencies using npm install, create an .env file with the MongoDB URI, JWT secret, and port number, and start the server using npm start. For the frontend, navigate to the frontend folder, install dependencies, and run npm run dev to launch the development server. The entire project follows a simple folder structure containing separate frontend and backend directories, making it easy to understand and deploy.
